# Blog Writing Style Guide

This guide defines the voice and formatting for all blog posts. Reference this throughout the writing process.

## Voice

- Write like you're explaining to a friend over coffee
- Use "you" and "I" freely
- Have opinions - don't hedge everything
- Ask rhetorical questions to engage the reader
- Be direct, not formal

## Sentence Rhythm

Vary sentence length deliberately. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones. A short sentence after a complex one creates emphasis.

**Example:**
> "The system processes requests asynchronously through a message queue, batching similar operations to reduce overhead and improve throughput. Simple, right?"

**Pattern to follow:**
- Long explanatory sentence
- Short punchy follow-up
- Medium connector
- Repeat

## Visual Rhythm

Never write more than 3-4 paragraphs of plain text without a visual break.

**Alternate between content types:**
- Text paragraph
- ASCII diagram or `[DIAGRAM: description]` placeholder
- Code block (with annotations)
- Bullet list
- Comparison table
- Blockquote for key takeaways

**Use tables for:**
- Comparing frameworks, tools, or approaches
- Listing pros/cons
- Feature comparisons

**Use blockquotes for:**
- Key insights
- Important warnings
- Memorable one-liners

## Formatting

- **Headers**: Spark curiosity, don't just label
  - Bad: "Implementation"
  - Good: "How it actually works"
- **Paragraphs**: Keep short (2-4 sentences max)
- **Code blocks**: Only when necessary, always annotate
- **Bullet points**: For scannable lists, not for everything
- **Bold**: For emphasis, use sparingly

## Phrases to Avoid

These make writing sound robotic or AI-generated:

- "In this article, we will..."
- "It should be noted that..."
- "I hope this helps"
- "Feel free to..."
- "Let's dive in"
- "In conclusion"
- "Without further ado"
- "As mentioned earlier"
- Unnecessary technical jargon
- Passive voice when active works better

## Phrases to Embrace

These feel natural and conversational:

- "Here's the thing..."
- "Let's break this down..."
- "The trick is..."
- "What I learned was..."
- "The part that surprised me..."
- "If you're like me, you probably..."
- "Real talk:"
- "Plot twist:"

## Call-to-Action by Post Type

End posts with an appropriate CTA:

| Post Type | CTA Style |
|-----------|-----------|
| Tutorial | "Try it yourself and let me know how it goes" |
| Deep-dive | "What questions do you still have?" |
| Showcase | "Check out the repo / demo" |
| Opinion | "What's your take? Drop a comment" |

## Meta Guidelines

**Titles:**
- Spark curiosity without clickbait
- Include the key benefit or topic
- Keep under 60 characters for SEO

**Meta descriptions:**
- 150-160 characters
- Summarize the value, not just the topic
- Include a hook

## Evolution

This style guide can evolve. If you develop new preferences or patterns that work well, update this file to capture them.
